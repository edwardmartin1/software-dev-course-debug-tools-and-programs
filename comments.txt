-Document the errors you found and how you fixed them.

When loading index.html in Google Chrome and then opening devtools, the console tab 
shows a TypeError.  
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'price')
calculateTotal @ cart.js:10
(anonymous) @ cart.js:32

To resolve this issue I looked at cart.js.  In the calculateTotal function, i is
incremented to 3 and then the check is performed for i <= cartItems.length.
The bug is that <= should be <.

cart.js also has issues where the parameters for the functions are not checked 
to make sure valid values are being passed from the arguments. The comment in 
the code states "Bug: Missing validation for discountRate" inside the applyDiscount 
function.   Also, there is a comment in the code that states "Bug: total may not be a number" 
inside the generateReceipt function.

To resolve issues of data validation I added try/catch blocks to validate that the 
data received into the parameters is correct.  

-Explain how debugging tools helped you locate and resolve issues.

I used breakpoints and the debugger statement to pause the execution of the 
code so that I could inspect the values of variables and see the flow 
of the program.  I examined error messages in the console to locate issues.  
I analyzed the call stack to trace the sequence of function calls that 
led to each error.
